# End-to-End Computer Vision MLOps

This repository documents the design and implementation of a **production-oriented computer vision system**, built incrementally using modern MLOps principles.

The project is structured as a **multi-stage journey**, starting from dataset validation and baseline training, and progressing toward experiment tracking, orchestration, deployment, and monitoring.

This is not a collection of isolated notebooks.
It is a system built step by step.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal is to demonstrate how a **real-world object detection project** can be taken from raw images to a production-ready pipeline using industry-aligned MLOps practices.

The use case is agricultural computer vision (sesame plant detection), but the architecture and lessons generalize to any detection problem.

## 🧱 Project Structure

The repository is organized by **stages**, not tools.

Each stage introduces new capabilities while building on artifacts from the previous one.
